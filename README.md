A simple word/sentence/character counter built as a practice project.
# Word & Character Counter Project

This is a simple practice project created to strengthen my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

🔹 It counts:
- Words
- Characters
- Sentences

✅ I built this as part of my learning process, inspired by an idea shown by my teacher.

🧠 The main goal was to apply what I’ve learned so far, not to create an original tool.
